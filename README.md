# Daniel Hardesty Lewis

Data Scientist and Researcher

Developing interpretable machine learning systems and scalable computational infrastructure.

I am a researcher at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) focused on explainable AI and distributionally robust machine learning for high-stakes financial applications. Previously, I spent 5+ years at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://tacc.utexas.edu/) scaling climate and flood models on world-leading supercomputers and leading work for the [$40M Texas Disaster Information System (TDIS)](https://www.glo.texas.gov/disaster-recovery/planning-studies/texas-disaster-information-system).

I founded [Summit Geospatial](https://summitgeospatial.com/) to deliver high-quality terrain data in Texas, and I am building [PoliBOM](https://www.polibom.com/) for tariff intelligence.

## Focus areas

- Interpretable and distributionally robust ML for financial forecasting
- End-to-end geospatial and flood modeling pipelines (source data to web delivery)
- High-performance computing for climate, terrain, and hydrology workloads

## Experience

- 2024 - Present: Research Assistant, [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/)

- 2023 - Present: Founder, [Summit Geospatial](https://summitgeospatial.com/)
  - Seamless elevation data products and scalable terrain workflows for Texas
- 2024 - Present: Co-founder, [PoliBOM](https://www.polibom.com/)
  - Tariff intelligence platform and decision tooling
- 2021 - 2023: Senior Data Scientist and Technical Lead, [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://tacc.utexas.edu/)
  - Led work supporting the [Texas Disaster Information System](https://idrt.tamug.edu/tdis/) and large-scale flood and climate modeling
- 2018 - 2021: Data Scientist and Research Engineer, [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://tacc.utexas.edu/)
  - Work spanning applied deep learning, model integration, and decision-support tooling
