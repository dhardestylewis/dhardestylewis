# Daniel Hardesty Lewis

Data Scientist and Researcher

I build interpretable machine learning systems and scalable geospatial infrastructure for high-stakes decision support.

I am a Research Assistant at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) working with [Ali Hirsa](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/ali-hirsa) on explainable and distributionally robust ML for financial forecasting. Previously, I spent 5+ years at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://tacc.utexas.edu/) scaling climate and flood models, including work supporting the $40M [Texas Disaster Information System (TDIS)](https://www.glo.texas.gov/disaster-recovery/planning-studies/texas-disaster-information-system).

I founded [Summit Geospatial](https://summitgeospatial.com/) (terrain data for Texas) and co-founded [PoliBOM](https://polibom.com/) (tariff intelligence).
